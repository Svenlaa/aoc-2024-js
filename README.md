# Advent Of Code 2024 in JS

Because I want to see how well I can code without AI

### Define words

**AI** in this context refers to Generative AI. GitHub Copilot and OpenAI like tools.

### The Guidelines

-   Use AI like you would StackOverflow
-   Do not mention Advent of Code to AI
-   Do not put the code into AI
-   The spirit of the guidelines are more important than the rules themselves
-   Don't go searching for loopholes
